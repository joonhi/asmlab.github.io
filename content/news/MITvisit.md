Hajoon Song visited MIT from July 1st to August 24th, 2018, as a visiting professor.
During the stay, he contributes to the project of the simulation of the Gulf of Arabia using a very high-resolution numerical ocean model with Professor John Marshall and Dr. MaryamRashed Alshehhi.
His role involved the launch of the ocean model, analyze and diagnose the model results, and visualize the simulation.
Another project he was involved with was the diagnosing the simulation of Arctic with
the interest of the heat transport from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arctic. This research will use the tool called “layers package”, and his research experience in this played a significant role.
